📏 QuantityMeasurementApp

📌 Project Description



QuantityMeasurementApp is a C# Console Application that allows users to measure and compare different quantities like Length, Weight, and Temperature using proper unit conversions.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

This application is developed using:



C#

.NET Console Application

NUnit for Unit Testing

Visual Studio Code





The main purpose of this project is to:



Understand Object-Oriented Programming concepts

Implement Unit Testing using NUnit

Apply TDD (Test Driven Development)

Handle unit conversions and comparisons

🚀 Features Implemented (Till UC7)



✅ UC1 – Compare Same Unit Length



Compare two lengths in same unit (e.g., 1 ft == 12 in)

Returns true if equal



✅ UC2 – Compare Different Length Units



Supports conversion between:

Feet

Inch

Yard



Example:

1 yard == 3 feet

1 inch == 1/12 feet



✅ UC3 – Addition of Length Units



Add two lengths of same or different units



Example:

1 ft + 2 in



Result stored using variable:

totalUnits



✅ UC4 – Weight Measurement



Support for:

Gram

Kilogram



Example:

1000 g == 1 kg



✅ UC5 – Addition of Weight



Add weights with proper conversion



Example:

1 kg + 500 g



✅ UC6 – Temperature Conversion



Supports:

Celsius

Fahrenheit



Conversion formula used:

°F = (°C × 9/5) + 32



✅ UC7 – Compare Temperature Values



Compare temperature values after proper conversion



Example:

0°C == 32°F
